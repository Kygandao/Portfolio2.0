# Portfolio2.0

Welcome to my updated portfolio.


Please see the deployed portfolio at https://kygandao.github.io/Portfolio2.0/
Repository located https://github.com/Kygandao/Portfolio2.0


This updated porfolio contains works that were not featured in the previous version.

Goal: The main goal for this portfolio project is to display works that I have completed, contributed to, and are currently working on, for future employers to see and for my own personal records.

As I continue to progress through the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp, I will continue to update content and polish this portfolio.
